    <h1>Mali Tigadigue Na</h1>

        <p>The meal I made today is called 
            Tigua Degué aka Mafé which is yet 
            another chicken in peanut sauce dish.
             This one differs from the rest by having several
              more vegetables involved and has more of a soup 
              like flavor (in my opinion). This is the national 
              dish of Mali and is also prepared similarly in Senegal
               (referred to as Mafé). I could not find out much information 
               on the dish, but it definitely reminds me of other 
            African dishes we have tried.</p>
